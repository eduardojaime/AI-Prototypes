New VA > Topics > Create with Copilot 

VA are expensive (100 per month)

Basically ChatGPT cannot be extended, trained or fine tuned with our organization data. This is due to the fact that it is already trained and fine tuned (GPT). Retraining and fine tuning are expensive tasks that require a lot of storage space (in TBs) and processing power.

Azure Cognitive Search can resolve this limitation:

- Indexing > Convert documents into inverted indexes for search
- Querying > Retrieve information from the indexes based on a query
